# Team 6: BreadBops

BreadBops is a website created for Gama Motors the used car dealership.

Why: When looking at the original website we found it to be very elementary, lacking many features for users to do things such as save cars and leave reviews. We created this project to solve that problem.

What: Our website has review features, saved car features, log in profile features, and car spec features, all stream lining the users experience to purchase a used car from the Gama motors dealership. 

Features:

- Sign up/Login
- Admin access
- Favorite car list
- Reviews/displaying reviews
- Car specs
- Car inventory
